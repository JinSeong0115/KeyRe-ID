The estimated poses are stored in an array of size 17x3
[[x1, y1, s1], ..., [x17, y17, s17]] where si is the joint detection confidence. 
On the PoseTrack dataset, we set a joint confidence threshold of 0.05 to 0.1 for the pose estimation task. 

The joints of a pose corresponds to the following classes:

class Joints:
    Nose = 0   # Nose
    LEye = 1   # Left eye
    REye = 2   # Right eye
    LEar = 3   # Left ear
    REar = 4   # Right ear
    LS = 5     # Left Shoulder
    RS = 6     # Right Shoulder
    LE = 7     # Left Elbow
    RE = 8     # Right Elbow
    LW = 9     # Left Wrist
    RW = 10    # Right Wrist
    LH = 11    # Left Hip
    RH = 12    # Right Hip
    LK = 13    # Left Knee
    RK = 14    # Right Knee
    LA = 15    # Left Ankle
    RA = 16    # Right Ankle
